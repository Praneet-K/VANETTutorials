# VANET Tutorials
This repository will hold the code used in my VANET YouTube Series (OMNET++, INET, Veins, and SUMO)

## What you need

In order to run this project you need the latest version of:
* INET (https://github.com/inet-framework/inet)
* Veins (https://github.com/sommer/veins)
* SUMO (http://sumo.sourceforge.net/)

## Videos in Series

### Introduction to VANETs

This video will give you a short introduction to VANETs (vehicular ad-hoc networks). You will learn what are VANETs, VANET architecture, potential applications, and research needs.

### Getting Started with OMNET++, INET, Veins, and SUMO

In this video, you will learn how to set up your OMNET++ environment, create your own workspace, and learn how to run INET, VEINs, and SUMO.

### How to Create a new OMNET++ Project that references INET and Veins

This video will show you how to create a new OMNET++ project that works with both INET and Veins.

### An Overview of OMNET++

In this video, we are going to review OMNET++. Specifically, we will learn how OMNET++ works and how .ned files and .ini work together.

### How to Make Mobile Hosts Communicate Wirelessly in OMNET++

In this video, we are going to learn how to set up a simulation where the mobile hosts communicate with each other wirelessly. This will be done using INET's standard host in OMNET++. You will learn how to make two hosts communicate with each other wirelessly, use INET's visualizer, and make your host move.
